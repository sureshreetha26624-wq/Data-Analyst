# Titanic Dataset -  Data Analysis (DA)

This project contains the Exploratory Data Analysis performed on the Titanic dataset using Python in Google Colab.

## Overview

The analysis includes:
- Basic understanding of the dataset
- Passenger distribution by age, gender, and class
- Survival analysis based on different factors
- Visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, bar charts, etc.)

## Key Observations

- Most passengers were between 20 to 40 years old.
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers.
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better chances of survival.
- Socio-economic status (Pclass and Fare) influenced survival more than age.

## Files Included

- **Titanic_EDA.ipynb** – The notebook containing all code and visualizations.
- **README.md** – This file explaining the project.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in:
   - Google Colab  
   - OR Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all the cells to see the complete analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

These libraries are already available in Google Colab.

## Purpose

This project is for practice and learning data analysis, visualization, and Python basics.
