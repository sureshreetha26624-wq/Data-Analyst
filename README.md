In this project, I carried out a structured data-cleaning process to transform the raw customer dataset into a consistent and reliable format. Key tasks included identifying and removing duplicate records, correcting data-type inconsistencies, and addressing missing values. Rows containing critical missing information—such as incomplete demographic or purchasing fields—were removed to maintain dataset integrity. Numerical fields such as Age and Income were standardized to appropriate integer formats, and overall formatting was aligned to ensure accuracy and uniformity across all variables.
Following this, I refined the dataset for improved usability in analytics and modeling. This involved validating categorical fields, ensuring consistent labeling, and retaining only complete and high-quality entries. The final cleaned dataset reflects the removal of duplicate observations, exclusion of four incomplete records, and standardization of all columns to clean, analysis-ready formats. This process ensures a reliable foundation for further exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.
