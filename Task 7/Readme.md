Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary using Python + SQLite:

This task focuses on extracting simple sales insights from a SQLite database using Python.

The dataset was first converted to a sales_data.db file and analyzed through SQL queries executed inside Python.

Objective:

1.Connect Python to a SQLite database

2.Run SQL queries from Python

3.Calculate total quantity sold and total revenue

4.Print results as a table

5.Visualize product-wise revenue using a bar chart

Files Included:

sales data.db – SQLite database created from CSV

task7.ipynb / task7.py – Python script for SQL + analysis

sales_chart.png – Generated bar chart

README.md – Documentation

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains basic sales information with the following fields:

1.product

2.quantity

3.price


Multiple entries for the same product are included to mimic real sales data.

SQL Query Used:

SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;

This query calculates:

1.Total quantity sold for each product

2.Total revenue generated by each product


Python Code Used:

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. CONNECT DATABASE
conn = sqlite3.connect("sales data.db")

# 2. RUN SQL QUERY
query = """
SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

print("Sales Summary:")
print(df)

# 3. PLOT BAR CHART
df.plot(kind='bar', x='product', y='revenue')
plt.title("Revenue by Product")
plt.xlabel("Product")
plt.ylabel("Revenue")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("sales_chart.png")
plt.show()
conn.close()


Insights

A product with the highest quantity sold does not automatically generate the highest revenue; pricing influences total revenue.

Items such as Shampoo or Soap may show higher total revenue due to higher value per unit.

The bar chart clearly reveals revenue distribution across the different products.
